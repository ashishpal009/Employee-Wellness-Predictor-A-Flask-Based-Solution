## Data Science Methodology

This project follows a systematic data science methodology:

1. **Problem Definition**: Identifying the need for a tool that predicts employee wellness based on various factors.
2. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data through user inputs that impact employee wellness.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Encoding categorical variables to convert them into a format suitable for machine learning models.
4. **Model Selection**: Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression) to predict employee wellness.
5. **Model Training**: Training the model using historical data to learn patterns and make predictions.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
7. **Deployment**: Deploying the trained model within a Flask web application for real-time predictions.
